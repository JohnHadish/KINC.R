# KINC.R

The KINC.R package provides supplementary R functions to assist with analysis of files used and generated by [KINC](https://github.com/SystemsGenetics/KINC).  Important functions are implemented here before being ported to KINC. Therefore, some scripts in KINC require KINC.R.  To fully use KINC please install KINC.R using the instructions below.

## Installation

Clone this repository and start R in the cloned directory:
```
library('devtools')
install()
```

Now you can use KINC.R in R by importing the library:
```
library('KINC.R')
```
